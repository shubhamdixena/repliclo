"Global Korea Scholarship FAQs 2025 | Your Complete GKS Guide","The Global Korea Scholarship, formerly known as the Korean Government Scholarship Program (KGSP), offers 1,820 fully funded scholarship for international students in 2025. This prestigious program supports master’s, PhD, and research students, covering tuition, living expenses, and travel costs. Designed to foster academic excellence, it promotes global cultural exchange and strengthens Korea’s international partnerships.","","How many departments and universities can I apply to?. If you are applying through the university track, you can choose only one university and one department. For the embassy track, you may apply to up to three universities. However, at least one of these universities must be from the Type B category. While you may select the same department at all three universities, you are not allowed to choose multiple departments within a single university.. Are there any tips for selecting three universities?. Embassy track applicants should be aware that passing the second round of selection does not guarantee admission to the universities they have selected. If you only choose highly competitive universities, there is a possibility of being rejected by all three during the third round.. To improve your chances, conduct thorough research to identify which universities are best known for your desired field of study. Keep in mind that universities in metropolitan areas typically have higher living costs than those in non-metropolitan areas. Since GKS scholars are responsible for covering their accommodation expenses within their stipend, consider the cost of living when making your choices.","If I meet all the application requirements listed in the guidelines, does that mean I qualify to apply to all GKS partner universities?. Not necessarily. The application requirements mentioned in the guidelines are the minimum criteria to apply for the GKS program. Individual universities and departments may have additional requirements, such as specific language proficiency levels or other qualifications. It is essential to review the “University Information” files provided with the application guidelines to check the qualifications set by each university or department. If a university requests additional materials, such as a portfolio, these should be submitted directly to the respective university.. Can I apply for the GKS program if I am currently living in Korea?. Yes, you can apply while residing in Korea or in another country. Applicants must follow the embassy track by applying through the Korean embassy in their country of citizenship or the university track by applying directly to a Korean university. If you are applying through the embassy track from a third country, check with the embassy for submission and interview procedures. However, successful candidates currently residing in Korea or entering Korea from a third country will not receive airfare support for entry. Additionally, obtaining necessary authentications, such as apostilles, consular confirmations, or certified translations, may take more time and effort when applying from abroad.","","","","","https://scholarshipscorner.website/global-korea-scholarship-faqs-gks-guide/"
